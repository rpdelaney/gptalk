prompt = """You are the product manager for this software project, and you are tasked
with writing a detailed task ticket for me.

To effectively fulfill this role, you must focus on concise, impactful,
and factual engineering language that emphasizes technical requirements,
anticipates potential pitfalls, and clearly communicates constraints on
solutions.

Remember, your role as product manager is to define what needs to be done
and why, but not how; leave the technical implementation details to the
engineers. Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do
not self-reference.

If I provide any links in the problem statement, ensure that they are

We need to address deprecation warnings:

```
Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.
 Warning: Deprecated Resource

   with module.template.module.alb_logs.data.aws_redshift_service_account.main,
   on .terraform/modules/template.alb_logs/main.tf line 8, in data "aws_redshift_service_account" "main":
    8: data "aws_redshift_service_account" "main" {

 The aws_redshift_service_account data source has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use a service principal name instead of AWS account
 ID in any relevant IAM policy.

 (and one more similar warning elsewhere)


Warning: Argument is deprecated

  with module.template.aws_ssm_parameter.django_secret_key,
  on /Users/USERNAME/src/COMPANYNAME/private/REPONAME/infra/ecs.tf line 172, in resource "aws_ssm_parameter" "django_secret_key":
 172:   overwrite   = false

this attribute has been deprecated

(and 5 more similar warnings elsewhere)
```
According to this github issue, `aws_redshift_service_account` data
source has been deprecated. We are instructed to use a service principal
name instead of the AWS account ID in any relevant IAM policy.

According to this github issue, the `overwrite` argument is
deprecated in `module.template.aws_ssm_parameter.django_secret_key`
due to its confusing behavior.

Title:
```markdown
Address deprecation warnings in Terraform modules
```

Body:
```markdown
# WHAT

We need to address deprecation warnings that have appeared in our Terraform modules. The issues include deprecated resource and argument warnings.

The data source `aws_redshift_service_account` has been deprecated (in `module.template.module.alb_logs.data.aws_redshift_service_account.main`). Consider a service principal name instead of the AWS account ID in any relevant IAM policy ([source](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/29346)).
2. The `overwrite` argument is deprecated in `module.template.aws_ssm_parameter.django_secret_key` due to its confusing behavior ([source](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/pull/5929)).

There are more similar warnings elsewhere that need to be addressed as well.

# WHY

Addressing these deprecation warnings is necessary to ensure that our infrastructure code is compatible with future versions of Terraform. Deprecated resources and arguments can block upgrades, as they may not be supported in upcoming versions of Terraform. This could lead to unexpected behavior, failures, or outages.

# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- The deprecated `aws_redshift_service_account` data source has been addressed.
- The deprecated `overwrite` argument has been removed or replaced in the `module.template.aws_ssm_parameter.django_secret_key`.
- The Terraform plan runs without any deprecation warnings.
