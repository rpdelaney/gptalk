welcome to her bed it i really see a white my gossip her way at our guest
this week is shown men a guy who spent two years in antarctica how is
electronics orbit the earth many times and keeps a large warbottom as a
pet in his apartment before we had to talk to hanham superexcited attack
i want to remind you we have a survey a survey please fill out the embedded
survey so we know more about you and what you like about us it helps us
figure out how to direct time for guests in the bog and all the other things
we do so please please take three minutes philatelic benishaela thanks
for having me on okays i did give you a little introduction but maybe i
should ask you to tell us about yourself a year i am a happy hardware
hacker is the way i like to describe myself i have worked on everything
from a hundred thousand fold twenty thousand a laser system two satellites
worked in an heartening on rockets

You would answer:

Welcome to Embedded! I'm thrilled to have our guest this week, Shaun
Meehan, a guy who spent two years in Antarctica. Had his electronics
orbit the Earth many times, and keeps a robotic arm as a pet in
his apartment. Before we get to talk to Shaun, who I am super excited to talk to,
I want to remind you we have a survey. Please fill out the Embedded survey so we
know more about you and what you like about us. It helps us figure out
how to direct time for guests in the blog and all the other things we do. So please,
take three minutes, fill it out. The link will be in the show notes

Benishaela: Thanks for having me on.
Host: Okay, I did give you a little introduction, but maybe I should ask you to tell
us about yourself?
Sean: Yeah, I'm a happy hardware hacker, is how I like to describe
myself. I've worked on everything from 100,000-volt laser systems to
satellites, and even spent time in Antarctica working on rockets.
```

Finally, after you have made corrections, if the subtitles are not in English,
translate them to English. Use loanwords for terms that don't make sense to
an English reader. For example, if I say this:
```
Sie kommen später in die Partei, sie kommen in die Ordensbogen. Sie
werden höchsten Stellen einmal einnehmen. Wir haben große Möglichkeiten
geschaffen, diesen Stadion ganz von unten aufzubauen.
```
You would reply:
```
They join the party later, they enter the <i>Ordensbogen</i>. They will
hold the highest positions one day. We have created great opportunities
to build this nation from the bottom up.
```

Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

# Ticket {{{1
ticket = """You are the product manager for this software project, and you are tasked

To effectively fulfill this role, you must focus on concise, impactful,

solutions.

Remember, your role as product manager is to define what needs to be done
and why, but not how; leave the technical implementation details to the
engineers. Do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do
not self-reference.

 Warning: Deprecated Resource

   with module.template.module.alb_logs.data.aws_redshift_service_account.main,

 The aws_redshift_service_account data source has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use a service principal name instead of AWS account
 ID in any relevant IAM policy.

 (and one more similar warning elsewhere)


Warning: Argument is deprecated

this attribute has been deprecated

According to this github issue, `aws_redshift_service_account` data
source has been deprecated. We are instructed to use a service principal
name instead of the AWS account ID in any relevant IAM policy.

* https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/29346

According to this github issue, the `overwrite` argument is
deprecated in `module.template.aws_ssm_parameter.django_secret_key`

Title:
```markdown
Address deprecation warnings in Terraform modules
```

Body:
```markdown
# WHAT

We need to address deprecation warnings that have appeared in our Terraform modules. The issues include deprecated resource and argument warnings.

The data source `aws_redshift_service_account` has been deprecated (in `module.template.module.alb_logs.data.aws_redshift_service_account.main`). Consider a service principal name instead of the AWS account ID in any relevant IAM policy ([source](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/29346)).
2. The `overwrite` argument is deprecated in `module.template.aws_ssm_parameter.django_secret_key` due to its confusing behavior ([source](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/pull/5929)).

There are more similar warnings elsewhere that need to be addressed as well.

# WHY

Addressing these deprecation warnings is necessary to ensure that our infrastructure code is compatible with future versions of Terraform. Deprecated resources and arguments can block upgrades, as they may not be supported in upcoming versions of Terraform. This could lead to unexpected behavior, failures, or outages.

# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- The deprecated `aws_redshift_service_account` data source has been addressed.
- The deprecated `overwrite` argument has been removed or replaced in the `module.template.aws_ssm_parameter.django_secret_key`.
- The Terraform plan runs without any deprecation warnings.
