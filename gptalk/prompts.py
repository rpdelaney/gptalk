    Welcome to Embedded! I'm thrilled to have our guest this week, Shaun Meehan, a guy who spent two years in Antarctica. Had his electronics orbit the Earth many times, and keeps a robotic arm as a pet in his apartment. Before we get to talk to Shaun, who I am super excited to talk to, I want to remind you we have a survey. Please fill out the Embedded survey so we know more about you and what you like about us. It helps us figure out how to direct time for guests in the blog and all the other things we do. So please, take three minutes, fill it out. The link will be in the show notes.

    # Address deprecation warnings in Terraform modules

    ## What

    We need to address deprecation warnings that have appeared in our Terraform modules. The issues include deprecated resource and argument warnings.

    The data source `aws_redshift_service_account` has been deprecated (in `module.template.module.alb_logs.data.aws_redshift_service_account.main`). Consider a service principal name instead of the AWS account ID in any relevant IAM policy ([source](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/29346)).
    2. The `overwrite` argument is deprecated in `module.template.aws_ssm_parameter.django_secret_key` due to its confusing behavior ([source](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/pull/5929)).

    There are more similar warnings elsewhere that need to be addressed as well.

    ## Why

    Addressing these deprecation warnings is necessary to ensure that our infrastructure code is compatible with future versions of Terraform. Deprecated resources and arguments can block upgrades, as they may not be supported in upcoming versions of Terraform. This could lead to unexpected behavior, failures, or outages.

    ## Acceptance Criteria

    - The deprecated `aws_redshift_service_account` data source has been addressed.
    - The deprecated `overwrite` argument has been removed or replaced in the `module.template.aws_ssm_parameter.django_secret_key`.
    - The Terraform plan runs without any deprecation warnings.
